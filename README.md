# catkin_virtualenv

This package provides a mechanism to:

    * export python library requirements in `requirements.txt` format via `package.xml`.
    * bundle a virtualenv within a catkin package, inheriting requirements from any dependencies.
    * wrap python scripts and tests in a catkin package with a virtualenv loader.

At CMake configure time, catkin will create a virtualenv inside the devel space, and create wrapper scripts for any
Python nodes in the package. These will also be installed into any bloomed debian package.

This library is GPL licensed due to the inclusion of dh_virtualenv.

### Exporting python requirements:

The package containing python modules with external library dependencies should define a `requirements.txt`:

```
GitPython==2.1.5
psutil==5.2.2
wrapt==1.10.10
```

It is good practice to include all dependencies with fixed versions in your requirements file. This will prevent a
version bump upstream from breaking your build. To obtain this list:

```
cd $(mktemp -d)
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install <python-packages-of-interest>
pip freeze --local | grep -v "pkg-resources" > requirements.txt
cat requirements.txt
```

Add an export to `package.xml`:

```
<export>
  <pip_requirements>requirements.txt</pip_requirements>
</export>
```

Make sure to install the requirements file in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
install(FILES requirements.txt
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_SHARE_DESTINATION})
```

### Bundling virtualenv:

It's possible to bundle all of a catkin package's python requirements, as well as those of its catkin dependencies,
into a virtualenv. This process will also override the standard `catkin_install_python` macro to wrap a virtualenv
loader around the specified python scripts.

Add an build dependency to `package.xml`:

```
<build_depend>catkin_virtualenv</build_depend>
```

In CMakeLists.txt:

```
# Make sure to find-package `catkin_virtualenv`
find_package(catkin REQUIRED ... catkin_virtualenv ...)

# Generate the virtualenv, optionally with python 3 as the default interpreter:
catkin_generate_virtualenv()
# catkin_generate_virtualenv(PYTHON3)

# Make sure your python executables are installed using `catkin_install_python`:
catkin_install_python(
  PROGRAMS
    scripts/do_python_things
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION})
```

Departing from convention, if these scripts are executable, `catkin build` will make them non-executable. This is
because `catkin_install_python` will now generate new wrapper scripts into the devel and install space that bootstrap
the virtualenv and `rosrun` gets confused if there's two executable scripts by the same name.

Any unit tests in the package added via `catkin_add_nosetests` should work within the virtualenv as well. The only
change is to add a dependency for the test target to the virtualenv target:

```
catkin_add_nosetests(test
  DEPENDENCIES ${PROJECT_NAME}_generate_virtualenv
)
```
